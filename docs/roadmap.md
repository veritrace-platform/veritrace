# Roadmap

## Milestones

| Milestone | Theme | Epics | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **M1 — Operational Core** | Multi-tenant WMS/TMS on GS1 identifiers with real-time cold-chain monitoring | EP0–EP3 | In progress |
| **M2 — Decentralized Trust** | Encrypted documents, on-chain commitments, public verification, operations | EP4–EP7 | Planned |

**Status values:** `TODO` · `IN_PROGRESS` · `BLOCKED` · `DONE`. A story is `DONE` when it meets the
[Definition of Done](guides/engineering-workflow.md#2-definition-of-done).

**Owners:** **BE** means backend and platform; **FE** means frontend. Story IDs identify work in this
document; they are not required in branch names, commits, or pull requests.

## M1 — Operational Core

### EP0 — Platform foundation

| ID | Story | Repos | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SCM-EP0-US01 | Architecture, domain rules, contracts, and ADRs for both milestones; project home repository with workspace tooling | veritrace | BE | DONE |
| SCM-EP0-US02 | Local environment: pinned compose stack, database bootstrap, Kafka topics, MQTT auth, gateway | platform-infrastructure | BE | DONE |
| SCM-EP0-US03 | Go service skeleton: config, logging, trace context, problem responses, admin server, graceful shutdown, migrations, Docker image, CI | core-business-service, telemetry-stream-service | BE | DONE |
| SCM-EP0-US04 | Organization-wide contribution files and repository hygiene | .github, all | BE | DONE |
| SCM-EP0-US05 | Demonstration kit: idempotent seed data (tenants, users, locations, products, lots), end-to-end scenario script, and runbook | platform-infrastructure | BE | TODO |
| SCM-EP0-US06 | Frontend foundations per ADR-0020/0021/0022: scaffold, typed API client, BFF session, i18n, real-time client, CI (one per repository) | enterprise-dashboard, driver-mobile-pwa, public-trace-portal | FE | TODO |

SCM-EP0-US05 comes last in M1. The kit seeds tenants, catalog data, and lots through the EP1–EP3 APIs, and its
scenario script doubles as the M1 acceptance run.

### EP1 — Multi-tenancy, identity, and access control

| ID | Story | Repos | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SCM-EP1-US01 | Tenant isolation foundation: tenant transaction helper, `SECURITY DEFINER` conventions, RLS isolation test harness | core-business-service | BE | DONE |
| SCM-EP1-US02 | Tenant registration with company prefix, headquarters GLN, and first admin | core-business-service | BE | DONE |
| SCM-EP1-US03 | Authentication: login, EdDSA access tokens, rotating refresh tokens, logout, JWKS, rate limiting | core-business-service | BE | DONE |
| SCM-EP1-US04 | User management and own-password change | core-business-service | BE | DONE |
| SCM-EP1-US05 | Access control policy function (per-action party, role, state, and context) | core-business-service | BE | DONE |
| SCM-EP1-US06 | Registration, login, BFF session, user management, and settings screens | enterprise-dashboard | FE | TODO |

### EP2 — GS1 warehouse and transport management

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SCM-EP2-US01 | GS1 library: Modulo 10, key validation with prefix ownership, SSCC issuance | core-business-service | BE | DONE |
| SCM-EP2-US02 | Location catalog (GLN, geo-fence) and GLN/tenant directory lookups | core-business-service | BE | DONE |
| SCM-EP2-US03 | Product catalog (GTIN-14, temperature bounds) | core-business-service | BE | DONE |
| SCM-EP2-US04 | Lot commissioning and inventory ledger (balances, movements) | core-business-service | BE | DONE |

| SCM-EP2-US08 | Transit checkpoints and delivery confirmation with destination geo-fence | core-business-service | BE | TODO |
| SCM-EP2-US09 | Emergency lot recall across tenants with operational lock | core-business-service | BE | TODO |
| SCM-EP2-US10 | Dashboard operations: overview, catalog, lots, inventory, shipments (create, assign, pickup code, delivery, cancel), recall, logistic label printing ([spec](frontend/enterprise-dashboard.md)) | enterprise-dashboard | FE | TODO |
| SCM-EP2-US11 | PWA flows: driver assignments, pickup, checkpoints; dock receiving; offline read-only cache ([spec](frontend/driver-mobile-pwa.md)) | driver-mobile-pwa | FE | TODO |

SCM-EP2-US01 was delivered with EP1, because tenant registration validates the headquarters GLN against the
company prefix.
