# VeriTrace Documentation

Product and engineering documentation for the VeriTrace platform. It is the reference for the whole
`veritrace-platform` organization. Each service repository documents only its own internals and links
back here.

## Start here

1. [Architecture overview](architecture/overview.md): what the system is and how the pieces fit together.
2. [Glossary](glossary.md): the domain vocabulary used everywhere.
3. [Roadmap](roadmap.md): milestones, epics, stories, and their status.
4. [Development setup](guides/development-setup.md): run everything locally.

## Sources of truth

| Concern | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Database schema | SQL migrations in the owning service (`migrations/`), designed in [data-model.md](architecture/data-model.md) |
| REST API | `api/openapi.yaml` in each service, following [rest-api.md](contracts/rest-api.md) |
| Messaging | [messaging.md](contracts/messaging.md) |
| Smart contract ABI | `smart-contracts` build artifacts, following [smart-contract.md](contracts/smart-contract.md) |

Code and documentation must agree. A change to one updates the other in the same pull request.
