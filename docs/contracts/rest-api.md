# REST API Contract

The rationale behind these conventions is in [ADR-0010](../adr/0010-rest-api-style-and-error-model.md).
Request and response schemas live in each service's OpenAPI document, which is the executable contract:

| Service | OpenAPI document |
| --- | --- |
| core-business-service | `api/openapi.yaml` |
| telemetry-stream-service | `api/openapi.yaml` |
| blockchain-relayer-service (M2) | `api/openapi.yaml` |

## 1. Conventions

| Topic | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Base URL | One origin through the gateway. Local: `http://localhost:8000` for API clients; frontends reach the API on their own origin ([ADR-0021](../adr/0021-frontend-origin-and-session.md)). |
| CORS | Not enabled. Browsers never call the API cross-origin; the WebSocket endpoint checks `Origin` against `WS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. |
| Versioning | Path prefix `/api/v1`. Breaking changes require `/api/v2`. |
| Format | `application/json; charset=utf-8`, `snake_case` fields. `null` means an explicitly empty optional field; optional fields may also be omitted. |
| Identifiers | UUID strings. GS1 keys are strings, never numbers. |
| Time | RFC 3339 UTC timestamps; `YYYY-MM-DD` dates |
| Numbers | Temperatures and coordinates are JSON numbers. Temperatures have at most 2 decimals, coordinates at most 6. |
| Authentication | `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` (EdDSA JWT, [ADR-0007](../adr/0007-token-authentication-with-eddsa-and-jwks.md)) |
| Collections | `GET` returns `{ "items": [...], "next_cursor": "opaque" \| null }`. Query `limit` defaults to 20 (max 100); pass `cursor` for the next page. Items are ordered newest first unless stated otherwise. |
| Creation | `201 Created`, a `Location` header, and the created resource in the body |
| Commands | State-changing actions are `POST` sub-resources (for example `/shipments/{id}/pickup`) that return the updated resource |
| Partial update | `PATCH` with a JSON merge patch (RFC 7396) of the mutable fields |
| Tracing | Clients may send `traceparent`. Every response carries `X-Trace-Id`. |
| Caching | Responses carry `Cache-Control: no-store` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, so no cache keeps tenant data. The JWKS may be cached for 5 minutes. A `405` lists the supported methods in `Allow`. |
| Limits | JSON bodies up to 1 MiB. Document uploads up to 25 MiB (M2). |
| Rate limits | Login and registration: 10/min per IP. Public endpoints: 60/min per IP. `429` responses include `Retry-After`. The client address is read from `X-Forwarded-For` behind the proxies listed in `TRUSTED_PROXIES` (the gateway and the frontend servers). |

### 1.1 Errors (RFC 9457 Problem Details)

`Content-Type: application/problem+json`

```json
{
  "type": "about:blank",
  "title": "Unprocessable Content",
  "status": 422,
  "code": "INVALID_GS1_IDENTIFIER",
  "detail": "gtin has an invalid check digit",
  "instance": "/api/v1/products",
  "trace_id": "4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736",
  "errors": [
    { "field": "gtin", "code": "CHECK_DIGIT", "message": "expected check digit 8" }
  ]
}
```

Clients branch on `code`, never on `detail` or `title`.

| Code | HTTP | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VALIDATION_FAILED` | 400 | Malformed JSON, missing or invalid fields (`errors[]` lists them) |
| `UNAUTHENTICATED` | 401 | Missing or invalid access token |
| `TOKEN_EXPIRED` | 401 | Access token expired; refresh and retry |
| `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` | 401 | Login failed. The message is the same for unknown email and wrong password. |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_INVALID` | 401 | Refresh token unknown, expired, revoked, or reused (reuse revokes the family) |
| `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | Visible resource, action not permitted |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Resource does not exist or is not visible to the caller |
| `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` | 405 | Route exists but does not support the HTTP method |
| `IDENTIFIER_ALREADY_REGISTERED` | 409 | Unique key taken (GLN, GTIN, GCP, tax code, tenant code, email, lot number) |
| `INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION` | 409 | Command not allowed in the current status |
| `SHIPMENT_RECALLED_LOCKED` | 409 | Command on a recalled shipment |
| `LOT_RECALLED` | 409 | New shipment or label series for a recalled lot |
| `INSUFFICIENT_STOCK` | 409 | Origin balance lower than the requested quantity |
| `SSCC_SERIAL_EXHAUSTED` | 409 | The tenant's SSCC serial space is used up |
| `INVALID_GS1_IDENTIFIER` | 422 | Length, non-numeric, check digit, or prefix mismatch (see `errors[].code`) |
| `SSCC_MISMATCH` | 422 | Scanned SSCC differs from the shipment |
| `OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE` | 422 | Reported position outside the facility geo-fence. Extension members: `distance_meters`, `allowed_meters` |
| `PICKUP_CODE_INVALID` | 422 | Wrong code (consumes one attempt). Extension member: `remaining_attempts` |
| `PICKUP_CODE_EXPIRED` | 422 | No active code, or code expired |
| `PICKUP_CODE_LOCKED` | 423 | Attempt limit reached; a new code must be issued |
| `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` | 413 | Body over the limit |
| `UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE` | 415 | Wrong `Content-Type` or document type |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | Too many requests |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | 500 | Unexpected failure (details only in logs, correlated by `trace_id`) |
| `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | 503 | Dependency down or shutting down |

Each entry of `errors[]` has its own `code`:

| Field code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `REQUIRED` | Missing or empty |
| `INVALID_FORMAT` | Does not match the expected format (pattern, email address, phone number) |
| `INVALID_TYPE` | Wrong JSON type |
| `INVALID_VALUE` | Not one of the allowed values |
| `TOO_SHORT`, `TOO_LONG` | Length outside the limits |
| `OUT_OF_RANGE` | Number outside the limits |
| `UNKNOWN_FIELD` | Not part of the request schema |
| `ALREADY_REGISTERED` | A unique value that another record holds (with `409 IDENTIFIER_ALREADY_REGISTERED`) |
| `INCORRECT` | Does not match the stored value, such as the current password |
| `LENGTH`, `NON_NUMERIC`, `CHECK_DIGIT`, `PREFIX_MISMATCH` | GS1 key errors ([gs1-identifiers.md](../domain/gs1-identifiers.md#validation-rules)) |

`422 INVALID_GS1_IDENTIFIER` is returned when only GS1 keys are invalid. When other fields are invalid too,
`400 VALIDATION_FAILED` lists every error, GS1 keys included. Text fields are trimmed; passwords are not.

## 2. Gateway routing

The API listener (`:8000` locally, `api.<domain>` in cloud mode) and each local frontend listener share
the table below. On a frontend listener (dashboard `:8001`, PWA `:8002`, portal `:8003`), every path that
is not listed goes to that frontend, including its `/bff/*` session routes.

| Path prefix | Service |
| --- | --- |
| `/ws/` | telemetry-stream-service |
| `/api/v1/telemetry/`, `/api/v1/public/telemetry/` | telemetry-stream-service |
| `/api/v1/proofs/`, `/api/v1/public/proofs/`, `/api/v1/public/batches/` | blockchain-relayer-service (M2) |
| `/.well-known/jwks.json`, everything else under `/api/v1/` | core-business-service |
