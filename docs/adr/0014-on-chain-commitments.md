# ADR-0014: On-chain commitments (M2)

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-09-25

## Context

The draft committed a Merkle root per shipment and status change, and stored SSCC strings on-chain. This
has four problems:

- It is effectively one transaction per event, not batching.
- It publishes business identifiers and shipment volumes on a public chain.
- `string indexed` event parameters are stored only as hashes, so an indexer cannot read them back.
- SHA-256 internal nodes are incompatible with the standard Solidity Merkle verification library.

## Decision

- **Epoch batching.** The relayer collects leaf hashes (shipment `event_hash` and incident
  `incident_hash`) and seals a batch when the first of these happens:
  - 10 minutes have passed since the oldest pending leaf;
  - 1024 leaves are pending;
  - a **priority** leaf (a recall event) arrives, in which case the batch is sealed immediately.

  No batch is sealed while nothing is pending, so an idle platform spends no gas. This keeps testnet
  usage within faucet allowances ([external-services.md](../architecture/external-services.md)).
- **Tree construction** is compatible with OpenZeppelin `StandardMerkleTree`:
  - `leaf node = keccak256(bytes.concat(keccak256(abi.encode(bytes32 leafHash))))`, a double hash that
    prevents second-preimage attacks;
  - leaf nodes are sorted;
  - internal nodes use the commutative `keccak256(sorted pair)`.
- **Contract:** `commitBatch(batchId, root, leafCount, manifestURI)` with strictly sequential `batchId`,
  plus the `verifyLeaf` view. The full interface is in [smart-contract.md](../contracts/smart-contract.md).
- **Transparency:** each batch's manifest (the ordered leaf list) is pinned to IPFS and referenced by the
  commit, so third parties can verify without trusting VeriTrace's API.
- **Nothing identifying goes on-chain.** Only roots, counts, and manifest URIs are published. Leaf hashes
  of events are unlinkable without the off-chain data.

## Consequences

- Cost is one transaction per epoch regardless of volume.
- Anchoring latency is up to 10 minutes, or seconds for recalls. The UI shows `PENDING` until then.
- Sequential batch IDs make a retried or sped-up commit fail harmlessly if an earlier attempt was already
  mined.
