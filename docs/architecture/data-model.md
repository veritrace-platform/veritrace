# Data Model

This document is the design reference for every database. The migrations in each service repository are
the executable source of truth. A pull request that changes one must change the other.

## 1. Conventions

| Topic | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Engine | PostgreSQL 18. The telemetry database adds the TimescaleDB extension. |
| Layout | One database per service, and one application schema per database (`core`, `telemetry`, `relayer`). `public` holds only the migration version table. |
| Naming | `snake_case`. Tables are plural nouns. Foreign keys are `<entity>_id`. Timestamps end in `_at`. Booleans start with `is_`/`has_`. |
| Primary keys | `id uuid DEFAULT uuidv7()`. UUIDv7 is time-ordered, which keeps indexes compact and supports cursor pagination. |
| Time | `timestamptz`, stored and exchanged in UTC. Calendar dates (production and expiration) use `date`. |
| Money-like and measured values | `numeric` with explicit precision. Never floating point. |
| Enumerations | `text` with a `CHECK` constraint. Values are `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. |
| Constraint names | `<table>_<columns>_key` (unique), `<table>_<column>_fkey`, `<table>_<rule>_check`, `idx_<table>_<columns>` |
| Audit columns | `created_at` on every table. `updated_at` on mutable tables, maintained by a trigger. |
| Tenant consistency | Tenant-scoped tables have a unique `(tenant_id, id)` key. A reference to a row that must belong to the same tenant is a composite foreign key on `(tenant_id, <entity>_id)`, so it cannot cross tenants. |

## 2. Database roles

| Role | Login | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `veritrace_core_owner` | yes | Owns `veritrace_core`; runs core migrations |
| `veritrace_core_app` | yes | Core runtime. `NOBYPASSRLS`, DML only, subject to RLS |
| `veritrace_telemetry_owner` | yes | Owns `veritrace_telemetry`; runs telemetry migrations |
| `veritrace_telemetry_app` | yes | Telemetry runtime |
| `veritrace_relayer_owner` | yes | Owns `veritrace_relayer` (M2) |
| `veritrace_relayer_app` | yes | Relayer runtime (M2) |

Role names are fixed across environments, and passwords come from the environment. Infrastructure bootstrap
creates the roles and databases. Migrations create everything else.

### 3.5 Security-definer functions

| Function | Used by | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `core.current_tenant_id()` | every RLS policy | the tenant from `app.current_tenant_id`, or `NULL` (fail closed) |
| `core.is_shipment_participant(shipment_id)` | shipment RLS policies | boolean |
| `core.is_lot_visible(lot_id)` | lot RLS policy | boolean |
| `core.register_tenant(...)` | registration | new tenant, headquarters, and admin IDs, and the creation time. Registrations run one at a time, and a company prefix that equals, extends, or is extended by a registered one is rejected. |
| `core.find_login_user(email)` | login | user ID, tenant ID, password hash, role, active flag (false for an inactive user or a suspended tenant); the email matches ignoring case |
| `core.find_auth_session(token_hash)` | token refresh, logout | session, family, tenant, and user IDs; the rest of the session is read and locked inside the tenant's transaction |
| `core.lookup_location_by_gln(gln)` | GLN directory, shipment destination | ID and public fields of an active location of an active tenant, and that tenant's ID, code, and legal name |
| `core.lookup_tenant_by_code(code)` | carrier or inspector lookup | ID, code, and legal name of an active tenant |
| `core.recall_lot(lot_id, reason, user_id)` | recall | recall ID, affected shipments (runs across tenants) |
| `core.public_*` (M2) | public trace API | public projections only |

Every such function:

- is owned by the owner role and declared `SECURITY DEFINER` with `SET search_path = pg_catalog, pg_temp`;
- schema-qualifies every object it uses (`core.tenants`). Functions written in SQL use a SQL-standard body
  (`RETURN …` or `BEGIN ATOMIC … END`), which resolves those references when the function is created;
- has `EXECUTE` revoked from `PUBLIC` and granted to the runtime role only;
- returns only the fields listed above and runs no dynamic SQL;
- has dedicated isolation tests.

### 3.6 Row-level security policies

Every table marked with RLS above enables row-level security in the migration that creates it, together
with its policies:

- Policies apply `TO veritrace_core_app`. Any other role has no policy and sees nothing.
- Policies read the tenant context as `(SELECT core.current_tenant_id())`. The scalar subquery runs once
  per query, whereas a bare call would run once per row.
- A policy is named after its rule, for example `tenant_isolation`.
- Tables do not use `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. The owner role owns every table and bypasses the policies,
  which lets migrations and the functions in §3.5 work across tenants without recursive policy checks.
- Views set `security_invoker = true`, so they apply the policies of the tables they read. The `core`
  schema has no materialized views, because they cannot carry policies.

A tenant-scoped table (RLS: tenant) uses this policy:

```sql
ALTER TABLE core.locations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON core.locations
    TO veritrace_core_app
    USING (tenant_id = (SELECT core.current_tenant_id()))
    WITH CHECK (tenant_id = (SELECT core.current_tenant_id()));
```

The core service's schema conventions test checks every migration for row-level security on each table,
policy roles, the `(SELECT …)` form, views, the ownership, grants, and `search_path` of §3.5 functions, and
the DML-only grants of the runtime role, so a migration that breaks one of these fails CI.

## 4. Telemetry database (`veritrace_telemetry`, schema `telemetry`)

Authorization is enforced in the application from the shipment projection (participants). The telemetry
database has no tenant-scoped RLS, because every row is keyed by SSCC and every read path checks
participation first.

**`sensor_readings`** (TimescaleDB hypertable on `recorded_at`, 1-day chunks)

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `recorded_at` | timestamptz | device time |
| `sscc` | char(18) | |
| `device_id` | text | `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}$` |
| `temperature_celsius` | numeric(5,2) | |
| `humidity_percent` | numeric(5,2) | nullable |
| `latitude`, `longitude` | numeric(9,6) | |
| `received_at` | timestamptz | |

- Unique `(sscc, device_id, recorded_at)`, which also makes inserts idempotent.
- Index `(sscc, recorded_at DESC)`.
- Compression after 7 days, segmented by `sscc`.
- A continuous aggregate `sensor_readings_15m` (avg, min, and max per SSCC per 15 minutes) serves charts
  and the public timeline.
